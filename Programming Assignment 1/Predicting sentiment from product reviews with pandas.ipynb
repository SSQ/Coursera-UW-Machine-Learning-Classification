Refer to appropriate manuals to produce sparse word count vectors. General steps for extracting word count vectors are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn a vocabulary (set of all words) from the training data. Only the words that show up in the training data will be considered for feature extraction.\n",
    "- Compute the occurrences of the words in each review and collect them into a row vector.\n",
    "- Build a sparse matrix where each row is the word count vector for the corresponding review. Call this matrix train_matrix.\n",
    "- Using the same mapping between words and columns, convert the test data into a sparse matrix test_matrix."
